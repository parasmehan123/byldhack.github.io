# Canteen Pre-Ordering System
## Made as a part of Byld Hackathon
## Ordering system to minimise the waiting time and return the approx. time required for the order.

###Main Features : 

Instead of database, we made the use of Google-Sheets-API's.

The data from the website is stored on Google sheets, which is then passed to the python script, which applies algorithm to process the order.

It script stores the approximate time needed to complete on the Google Sheets and displays it on the website.

The website of the project is hosted at this [link](https://byldhack.github.io/).
